//Q.10 Simulating a Dice Roll Game

Scenario: Simulate a dice roll game where a player rolls two dice until they get a double. We'll simulate rolls by incrementing counters and resetting them. Use a while loop to simulate the rolls and print each roll's result until a double is rolled.

Note: You have to create and add a JS file and code the answers of the questions mentioned above in it.
